**A class (the factory) decides which concrete class to create, hiding the object creation logic from the client code.**

## Why do we use a Simple Factory?

**Without it:**

- Your code directly calls `new ConcreteClass()` everywhere.
- You scatter creation logic in many places.
- Itâ€™s harder to change how objects get built.

**With it:**

- You centralize all creation logic in one place.
- Your code depends on abstractions (e.g., `PricingStrategy`), not implementations.
- Adding new types is easier.
